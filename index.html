        <h1>Last Favourite Movie: Deadpool and Wolverine</h1>
    </header>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The last movie that I watched was Deadpool and Wolverine. I thoroughly enjoyed this film as it found an interesting way of merging 
    humour, storylines, and cameos to make the move a fun experience. The movie included the main characters going on a mission to save the 
    world and their friends from a threat that would obliterate their universe. This movie also introduced many forgotten characters 
    within the Marvel universe which made the movie much more enjoyable and also added to the overall plot of the movie. 
</p>

<h2>Favorite Moments</h2>
<p>
    This movie is a rated-R movie and did have several moments that made me laugh quite a bit such as the lines, the vulgar scenes, and the overall chemistry between the characters.
    At the end of the day, would I suggest someone to watch this movie? If you do not mind watching a movie that does have vulgar scenes, then yes definitley do so.
